# DATS 6202: Machine Learning 1 Final Project
## Time Series Prediction of Foreign Exchange Rates Using LSTM

This repo consists of the final project for Grady Renfrow and Andrew Gobbi. In it, we examine the forecasting potential of a simple LSTM architecture in making onestep ahead forecasts of the Swiss Franc to United States Dollar (CHF/USD) and Brazilian Real to United States Dollar (BRL/USD) daily time series. We test our model on movements in time series levels and first differences.
